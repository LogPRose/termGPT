<h1>Hello, welcome to termGPT!</h1>
<p> I've found myself frequently tabbing between my terminal editor,<a href="https://github.com/LogPRose/nvim">NVIM</a> and my browser in order to use chatGPT for help with syntax or boilerplate code!
I decided to make a python script that would use the chatGPT API in order to access chatGPT with a split terminal window</p>
<p> This JSON response returned will be output to the terminal itself but will also be written into a log-file for ease of yanking</p>
<p> For ease of setup I will leave all of the code available, all you will need to do is setup your own .env file with your keys!</p>
